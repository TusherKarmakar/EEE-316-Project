The objective of the power electronics project "Variable DC Battery Charger with Auto cutoff Feature and Deep Discharge Control of Battery" is to design and implement a battery charger that can charge a battery with a variable DC output up to cutoff set to a defined percentage of rated battery voltage and a circuit that will let the battery to discharge up to a fraction of rated voltage and then isolates it. The charger will use a converter to convert the AC input voltage to a variable DC output voltage that can be adjusted to meet the specific requirements of the battery being charged. The charger will also include an auto cutoff feature that will automatically shut off the charging process when the battery is fully charged. In case of discharging, when the Voltage level of Battery is below a certain threshold level it will stop discharging and be turned off.
